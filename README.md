# Dataset for Object Detection dataset
Object Detection allows for software to recognise an object and its location within an image. The location is defined by its bounding box.
The object detection algorithm is based on training a neural network on a collection of images and bouding boxes, which are combined in a dataset. This git repository provides a currated list of object detection dataset available, as well as a record of my own datasets.
